# Bronze Award

### Shef Food is proud to announce, Sheffield has received the Bronze Award from Sustainable Food Places!

We are delighted the plethora of good food-related action across Sheffield has achieved the Bronze Award and are proud of all of the organisations, people and companies working to tackle the 6 key issues within our food system.

As much as we love to celebrate, we're not stopping here. Our next goal will be to support, amplify, coordinate and deliver a food system in Sheffield that is worthy of the **Silver Award!** 

As a partnership, we are aiming to bid for the Bronze-to-Silver Grant which we hope will enable further conversations, activity and change across Sheffield. It is vital, in this next step, to engage local government and public bodies. Through increased connections, we can mobilise more and encourage further positive action with Sheffield, within our local food system. 

If you would like to help, email us at info@sheffood.org.uk.

# Sustainable Food Places

Sustainable Food Places (SFP) is a partnership programme that supports places across the UK on their journey towards creating sustainable, equitable and healthy food systems. The programme runs an award scheme which recognises places who are undertaking this journey, with the opportunity to win Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards.

The SFP application form breaks down a sustainable, healthy and equitable food system into six key issues. To achieve the award we have researched, contacted and collaborated with organisations and communities across Sheffield to highlight how Sheffield is tackling each key issue. These being;  

1. Taking a strategic and collaborative approach to good food governance and action.
2. Building public awareness, active food citizenship and a local good food movement 
3. Tackling food poverty and diet related ill-health and increasing access to affordable healthy food.
4. Creating a vibrant, prosperous and diverse sustainable food economy. 
5. Transforming catering and procurement and revitalizing local and sustainable food supply chains.
6. Tackling the climate and nature emergency through sustainable food & farming and an end to food waste
