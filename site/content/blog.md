# Farming Sheffield's Fringe - 7th July 2021

### Event report.

Fran Halsall, 23rd July 2021. 

We are pleased to report that last week's Farming Sheffield's Fringe event was a great success.  All those involved were really supportive of the first conference of its type within Sheffield and this created a great energy within the room.   The growers in attendance were delighted to be in the same room as local and regional government.  The voice of small scale food producers is not often heard and here they were given a platform to present not only all the good work they have achieved but also talk about difficulties they have faced and how these issues can be addressed going forward.

This meeting of minds and genuine enthusiasm to work towards common goals will carry over into the follow up of ideas / actions raised on the day and the development of future relationships with the City Council and the Sheffield City Region.

The event launched with an introduction from the High Sheriff of South Yorkshire, Martin McKervey, who presented an overview of the topics to be addressed throughout the event.

The first presentation was given by Rob Logan, Sustain's lead on Fringe Farming.   Entitled [Why farm the urban fringe?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvC68gtGhUSXxyO_Rhrc7QPP_VIhrm5P/view?usp=sharing)  Rob introduced the economic, environmental and social case for prioritising agroecological food production at the city's edges.  This set the theme for the morning's session – understanding both the positive contributions made, and the challenges faced, when farming sustainably and at the smaller scales typical of this type of approach. 

Next up was a short film [The Moss Valley Story](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pny_xRO5J1-JAV_HWby3WysSgNpE-K38/view?usp=sharing) featuring Heather Hunt, of Green New Deal South Yorkshire, who owns land in the Moss Valley and who has been instrumental in the development of low-carbon food production just over the border in North East Derbyshire.  Heather not only talked about the value of collaborative working but also about agroecology's role within restoring this special landscape. 

Then we were joined by three of Sheffield's food growers, Huw Evans of [Sheffield Organic Growers](https://www.sheffieldorganicgrowers.co.uk/) and Doug Kemp of [Regather](https://regather.net/farm/) – both based in the Moss Valley -- and Darrell Maryon of [Heeley City Farm](https://www.heeleyfarm.org.uk/), who is their head grower.  After each gave an account of their own experiences - Doug as a new entrant to farming, the other two reflecting on their many years of professional practice – Fran Halsall, ShefFood's Urban Agriculture Co-ordinator, chaired a discussion about the barriers each of them has faced. Namely: access to land, finance and national support networks that can be hard to access as a small grower.  

The second theme of the day – collaborative working with the City Council – was introduced by Gareth Roberts.  In his presentation [Low carbon food infrastructure in Sheffield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q9WtGkyPwrvYsQPdP9N_nSjzl4Kqncuy/view?usp=sharing) he explored the benefits of developing community growing projects across the city, where today's amateur growers become tomorrow's apprentices and our future food growing professionals. Gareth also previewed the development of ShefFood's Urban Agriculture Taskforce that will: identify opportunities; formulate responses to land that could become available; and act as the link between future farmers and the Council.  

Next to speak was Deputy Leader of the Council, Julie Grocutt, whose topic was [Why local food production is important to Sheffield City Council.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcLdTKoUE1ljW2QpGR-A_Cst6KpMR-v6/view?usp=sharing) Julie congratulated Sheffield on achieving a Sustainable Food Places Bronze Award, and committed to supporting the City on it’s journey to a SFP Silver Award. She covered how food production cut across many council policy areas: economy, sustainability, poverty, public health and more.  Julie spoke about the Food Ladders model, supporting food projects that assist the vulnerable while encouraging community ownership of the means of production.

Julie was then joined by Cllr. Alison Teal, Executive Member for Sustainable Neighbourhoods, Wellbeing, Parks and Leisure,  in a discussion chaired by Leon Ballin of [Sustainable Food Places](https://www.sustainablefoodplaces.org/) on the ways in which to create new opportunities for peri urban food growing in the city and the wider region.  During this conversation it was agreed that Alison will become Sheffield’s first ‘food champion’, meaning that she will be working closely with ShefFood to build a collaborative approach to improving the local food system.

The third session saw Richard Sulley, Net Zero Project Director for the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, give a talk on [Farming Sheffield’s Fringe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHPNLWZPe73ud8fv4nxD9-vRaktGEKSq/view?usp=sharing). In which he outlined the positive potential of agroecological food production within the context of the SCR 2041 vision to develop the green economy.    This included an honest reflection on the failure to take Scope 3 carbon emissions - which includes food imported from outside the region -  into account within previous strategies.  

This was followed by Mark Walton, of Shared Assets, presentation on [How urban agroecology can help tackle climate change](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_sAI9QLnueGHky-xUy5wZRqNpukNrLAY/view?usp=sharing).  Taking a ‘whole systems’ approach, Mark examined how sustainable farming practices allow soil to store more carbon, improving its water retention capacity.  Plus how turning urban waste streams into compost can replace the conventional fertilisers that emit nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  All of which can be measured using the [Farm Carbon Toolkit](https://farmcarbontoolkit.org.uk/about-us), of which he gave a working example.

The third and final session was wrapped up with a discussion, led by Gareth Roberts with Mark and Richard, which explored how different ways of viewing the food system, through carbon, economy, society and culture, shape the narratives which inform our understanding of the food system. These in turn shape government policy, sector practice and public attitudes towards how we can change our food system and behaviours for the better. Significant challenges were highlighted relating to measuring the carbon footprint of our food system, producing evidence which effectively informs policy making, finding the appropriate balance between behaviour change and system change and developing ‘good food’ narratives at the regional level.

On behalf of ShefFood we would like to offer our thanks and gratitude to everyone involved in making this event such a success, and to everyone who attended the event, both in person and online.
