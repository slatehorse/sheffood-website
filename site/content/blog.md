## **Farming Sheffield's Fringe:**  developing peri-urban agroecological food production around Sheffield and beyond.

Fran Halsall, 28th June 2021. 

On 7th July ShefFood are hosting the 'Farming Sheffield's Fringe' event, a collaboration with
[Sustain](https://www.sustainweb.org/) , [Shared Assets](https://sharedassets.org.uk/) and the[ Land Workers Alliance](http://landworkersalliance.org.uk/). These organisations have come
together to deliver the national '[Fringe Farming](https://www.sustainweb.org/foodandfarmingpolicy/fringe-farming-peri-urban-food-growing/)' programme. ........

This initiative seeks to understand the barriers that currently limit agroecological farming at the edges of cities. Fringe Farming works locally - to identify land opportunities and support community action, and nationally - to influence the policies that will enable a new generation of peri-urban food producers.

Sheffield is among four cities – London, Bristol and Glasgow being the others – participating in
the programme and ShefFood are embracing this opportunity to push for more peri-urban food
production around the city. In preparation for the event, the partner organisations have
produced a [pre-event briefing document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tMDC8buXA2jWFHixg2Ibp6LR3ZVC0P8s/view?usp=sharing).

In this report, Sheffield's fringe farming potential is thoroughly explored. It finds that local, low-
carbon food production has an essential role to play in both meeting zero carbon targets and building a more equitable and secure food system.

The event will be launched by Martin McKervey, the High Sheriff for South Yorkshire, and we
are pleased to announce the following speakers: Richard Sulley - Net Zero Project Director for
the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority; Cllr. Alison Teal - Executive Member for
Sustainable Neighbourhoods, Wellbeing, Parks and Leisure; and Cllr. Julie Grocutt - Deputy
Leader and Cabinet Member for Community Engagement and Governance. Plus we'll be
hearing from some of our local growers as well as representatives from partner organisations,
including [Green New Deal South Yorkshire](https://www.sheffieldclimatealliance.net/gndsy).

'Farming Sheffield's Fringe' is open to anyone with a passion for scaling up local and
sustainable food production. You will be able to share your questions, thoughts and ideas
during a series of discussion sessions held throughout the event. The aim of the day is to to
devise a set of tangible actions that will guide the next steps in the transformation of Sheffield's
food system.

In line with current Covid guidelines, this will be a hybrid event with speakers meeting in one
location and audience members invited to join by video link. Booking a[ free ticket](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/farming-sheffields-fringe-tickets-156675162629) grants you
