## Why Sustainable Food?

The food we rely upon every day is a product of a complex, interdependent and globalised supply chain dominated by relatively few multinational corporations. The security of these supply chains is week as witnesses through COVID-19 and Brexit and the sea of empty shelves.

The scale of this system exploits the enviroment and miximises profit out of producers and consumers. This unsustainable system contributes to (and is vulnerable to) the impacts of climate change, depletion of resources such as oil, phosphorus, soil and water, pressures of population growth and geo-political instability such as austerity. As a consequence, the UK and Sheffield food system is impacted in a range of ways, including for example:

* Food Sovereignty – the UK currently produces less than 60% of the food we consume, relies on the EU for nearly 30% of food imports and holds only 3-5 days of food supplies in reserve.
* Food Waste – it is estimated that UK households waste 7 million tonnes of food and drink each year, costing an annual average £470 per household. Most of this waste could be avoided.
* Health Inequality & Food – access to healthy food is a key factor determining the extent of health inequality across different parts of Sheffield, with life expectancy gaps and adult obesity rates amongst the highest in England.
* Poverty & Food – over the past 5 years many food banks have opened in Sheffield, with benefit delays, low income and benefit changes being the most common reasons for accessing food bank services.

Developing a sustainable food system for Sheffield is a huge challenge. But thankfully - true to their character – the people of Sheffield are still rising to this challenge. Since the mid-1980s there have been progressive food plans, strategies and policies developed on an understanding that local government, the NHS, universities, business and Sheffield communities must all work together in partnership to create the lasting change needed. This important work continues - today and into the future.

A renewed energy and enthusiasm is present in Sheffield communities where decades of amazing local food work continues to blossom. A major challenge ahead is to turn post-Brexit price increases, farm labour shortages and market volatility into opportunities for the community economic development of urban and peri-urban horticultural enterprise – intensively grown organic fruit and vegetables, developing skills and community resources, creating local employment and promoting sustainable local economies.

There is a shared vision and strategic commitment to develop the environmental and economic benefits of a more resilient and sustainable food system for the Sheffield City Region. So - could the next planned step be to demand the regional devolution of a post-Brexit agricultural policy? A policy which could be developed and resourced to support environmentally, socially and economically resilient mixed farming systems and land based industries – creating a truly productive landscape for Sheffield.
