## Why Sustainable Food?

Across the UK, cities have recognised the key role food can play in dealing with some of todayâ€™s most pressing social, economic and environmental challenges and are taking a joined up approach to transforming their food culture and food system. From obesity and diet-related ill-health to food poverty and waste, climate change and biodiversity loss to declining prosperity and social dislocation, food is not only at the heart of some of our greatest problems but is also a vital part of the solution.

## What Does ShefFood Do?

We are working towards a Sustainable Food Cities Award for Sheffield by taking action across six key areas. These are:

1. Promoting healthy and sustainable food to the public
2. Tackling food poverty, diet-related ill health and access to affordable healthy food
3. Building community food knowledge, skills, resources and projects
4. Promoting a vibrant and diverse sustainable food economy
5. Transforming catering and food procurement
6. Reducing waste and the ecological footprint of the food system
