# ShefFood's Partners

<div align="left" ><font size="4" style="font-family:Calibri" >
Throughout this 12 year period (2009-21) a group of people with a passion for sustainable food have continued, with limited resources, to meet regularly and work together. All of the partners represent voluntary, community, faith, social enterprise, local authority, academic and commercial organisations which have found solidarity to coordinate and deliver activity in an open, transparent and democratic way as an independent food partnership and the Sustainable Food Places member for Sheffield. 

Although we encourage anyone to get involved with ShefFood's mission, there is a range of core partners who work across the food sector and meet monthly to coordinate, update and share ideas, news and actions associated with Sheffield's food partnership.
