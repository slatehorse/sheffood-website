## No Junk Fruit Juicing | Sat | 2-4pm

Kids love drinking fruit juice, but do they know how easy it is to make? Kids can get hands on and messy as they learn about the simple process of making (and drinking!) fruit juice. Fresh fruit, leftover fruit or any fruit that would otherwise go to waste will be available to use, so it’s a great opportunity to learn about reducing food waste too.

## Keeping Chickens At Home | Sun | 2-4pm

Kids love visiting the farm and learning where their food comes from. Kids also love taking care of pets. Keeping chickens is a great way to combine both, plus the family gets to eat fresh, tasty eggs. There will be a small flock of hens to watch and feed, and people who are passionate about chickens to talk with.

## Kids Seed Sowing | Mon | 2-4pm

Kids love growing their own veg & once they have grown their own they are more likely to eat them and they’ll have learned a little bit about where food comes from. Kids can decorate their own pot and plant some veggie seeds to take home. Even if you don’t have a garden you can grow your own delicious vegetables in a window box or on a balcony, it’s easy!

## Disco Soup | Sat - Mon | 4-6pm

Join the party as we collect, chop, and cook leftover food or any food that would otherwise go to waste. The music will be pumping, everyone will be dancing and we’ll all enjoy delicious soup!
