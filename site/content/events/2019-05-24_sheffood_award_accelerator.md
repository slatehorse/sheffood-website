## What is the ShefFood Award Accelerator?

It's a series of short, engaging activities focused entirely on recognising and celebrating the fantastic work you and your organisation does for food and drink in Sheffield, and achieving a Sustainable Food Cities Bronze Award for Sheffield.

## What is ShefFood?

ShefFood is the food partnership for Sheffield. We are a cross-sector partnership of local public agencies, businesses, academic and community organisations committed to working together to create a more sustainable food system for Sheffield.

## Why should you attend?

Your participation will significantly increase the ability of Sheffield to achieve a Sustainable Food Cities Bronze Award by 2020, which is all about recognising Sheffield as a city taking action across 6 Key Issues:

Promoting healthy and sustainable food to the public
Tackling food poverty, diet-related ill health and access to affordable healthy food
Building community food knowledge, skills, resources and projects
Promoting a vibrant and diverse sustainable food economy
Transforming catering and food procurement
Reducing waste and the ecological footprint of the food system

## What will you be asked to do?

The workshop will involve a series of engaging activities designed to help capture what you and your organisation are doing towards achieving significant positive change on a range of key food issues. By the end of the session we will help you to:

become an active, connected member of ShefFood
identify your roles and relationships within the Sheffield food system
explore your positive social impact on health, communities and livelihoods
become an active, connected member of ShefFood
recognise and celebrate your work towards the Sustainable Food Cities '6 Key issues'
